It’s sometimes hard to remember there was once a world where computers were not ubiquitous – where no pockets carried a smartphone, where no workplace had an intranet, where a message sent to the other side of the world could take months to arrive, and where working through the consequences of complex equations meant a lot of pencil and paper. These, and other apps and the software services behind them, have enabled millions of us to work safely from home and children to participate in online classes – all vital to keeping the economy moving, maintaining social distancing and reducing infection transmission.
The services are underpinned by internet protocols, which were first laid down by computer scientists in the early 1970s, and more recent advances in cybersecurity and Internet technology for reliable large-scale communication. The apps are visually appealing and easy to use because they incorporate years of research within the field of human computer interaction.
Epidemiologists have been able to model, predict, and keep close track on infection rates because of new algorithms and advances in the power of computing hardware and software. It’s easier and cheaper than ever to collect and store huge amounts of data on the variation and spread of disease, and never simpler to share data with colleagues around the world. Visualisation software has been essential, both for scientists to communicate with politicians, and for politicians and scientists to communicate with the general public - think “next slide please”!
Last but not least, computing has enabled internet shopping, from secure online transaction technology, to optimisation algorithms for logistics and home deliveries guided by GPS.
One hundred years ago, none of this technology was available to help manage the spread of a deadly influenza. Even 30 years ago, much of the computing infrastructure that has helped us cope with life and fight back against the disease simply didn’t exist.
